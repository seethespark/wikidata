## Changing site information ##
There are two types of modification you can do to your Sites pages.  If text content needs changing then append /content to the URL.  Nearly every page has some content which can be changed.  Some pages have specific data which can be changed and this is accessed by appending  /edit to the URL.  In particular, blog pages are edited this way.

### /content ###
When you append /content to a URL you will be asked to sign in. Once you are authenticated you can change text in any box with a blue border.  Each editable area has a couple of control icons in the top right corner. The little disk saves any changes.  The little page with </> in allows you to edit as HTML.  This gives advanced users more control over look and feel.  
Somethimes editable areas are too small for these controls.  If you can't see the text then click on the </> icon and the box becomes a bit bigger.

### Site template ###
Changing the site template changes the look and feel of every page in your Site.

### Page title ###
The heading which appears in the tab or browser window when the page is viewed.

### Page template ###
Change the look and layout of the current page.  Where possible the text areas will translate between templates so hopefully you don't have to re-type content when the template changes.

### Theme variables ###
Some themes have settings which need changing for the overall theme or can't easily be changed in the editor window.

### Images ###
All images assocuiated with a Site are listed.  They can be deleted or dragged onto image sections in the main site window.

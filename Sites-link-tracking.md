Sites has a ridimentary but effective inbound link tracking system.

### Setting up ###
Navigate to [your Sites address]/l/edit (that's l for link in the middle).
Enter a character in the first cell, under ID.
This will create a new row with a new ID.  
Enter a name for your inbound link, this will help monitoring who uses it.
Enter a path to redirect to once the link has been logged.  / is the most obvious one to use but you can use any relative path or full URL.
Now you can use the ID to track any inbound links on external sites.  On the external site make sure the URL used is in the format [your Sites address]/l/[the ID]. For example https://seethespark.com/l/awr7uo will take you to See The Spark's home page but will also log the inbound link.

Under usage, hovering over the IP address tells you the domain of the client.
Double clicking on an IP address stops that IP address from being visible.  This is useful if you have an inbound link from Facebook as that tends to generate a lot of spurious hits as they check the URL.

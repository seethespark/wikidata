## DataLoad##
DataLoad is a lightweight Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tool. It is fast and flexible. There are big ETL packages available but often these require specialist knowledge to implement. Then when things change the same specialists need to be called in again. DataLoad allows tables and sources to be added by anyone with basic knowledge. Data transfer should be as fast as any of the big players.

The origin of DataLoad was frustration at using inflexible systems which required redeployment when new columns were added to a table.

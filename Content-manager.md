## Adding a new page ##
Make sure the page has <article> tags or elements with the editable class. Add content with properties named the same as the containing element's ID.  Wrap the editable property in ''triple'' braces like this: {{{content.myTextArea}}}

Navigate to the path /<pagePath>/content

Make a change

Save!

## Editing page content ##
You must be in the contentEditor group.

You can only edit content of pages which the side developers have allowed.

Either use the Admin dashboard at /admin or navigate to /<pagePath>/content.

Edit the text content.  Click on the </> button to edit the HTML directly.

Click save.

To change the page title scroll to the bottom of any editable page and change the title section.  If it has a leading space then remember to delete that after you have added the title.  This is a bug but bear with us for now.

The template can be changed but changing it to an invalid value will break the page.

All changes take effect immediately on the server but browsers will use cached content for a period of time.

[[Repley technical reference]]
[[Reply report editing]]

Repley is a simple yet powerful reporting server. The reporting engine allows you to use your own HTML templates to design reports.

Its core purpose is to quickly get data in front of those who need it most.  The editing interface is intuitive and uses SQL which allows those who know the data best to swiftly build reports.  

Report data is cached and so even long running reports, after they have run once, are quick to display data.

All reports use snippets of standard HTML so any in house design team can change the look and feel to best suit a customer's needs.  The appearance isn't restricted to what we at See The Spark think is best.

After reports have run the data can be converted to Excel.
